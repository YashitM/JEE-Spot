        	<strong>Tips</strong> 
    </div> 
    <div id="TipsContent">
    	<p>Entrance exams are not designed to test how wide your knowledge is, they’re to test how deep it is. From many personal accounts, we have collected tips from a few students and have given a gist of them below.</p> 
        <ul>
        	<li>
            	<span id="TipsSubHeading"><strong>Coaching Institute</strong></span>:
                <p>Needless to say, going to a good coaching institue is very important. Going purely by the result may not be the best way to decide which coaching institute to join. Do not go purely by the result. The decision must be made after considering the quality of students and the faculty. It is wiser to speak to a few teachers, relatives or friends who have actually studied in the institute, so that it’s not just the hype which gets to you.</p>
<p>Kota, Rajasthan has a student population (11th, 12th and 13th) of more than 2.5 lakhs. Out of which barely 5000 qualify. There is a very good set of faculty in most institutes in Kota. But with more than 100 students in class, the teacher-student interaction for doubt clearing is very limited. Students help each other out. Which is a very good idea, but it is something that you must consider before joining the institute. </p>
<p>Another part you have to look into is the transportation media. Unless the coaching institute is excellent, avoid going to the ones that are very far.
A major challenge which I faced during my preparation was time management. I didn’t know many who could manage their time wisely.</p>
<p>Try joining a programme in which the coaching institute and the school have a partnership. It will save travel time and help you be more productive. There are some non-attending schools that you can join. Attendance is not a concern there! All they require from you is to write the exams on time.
Creating a proper time table is very important. In 11th, I kept on wandering here and there and did whatever was thrown at me. The year ended with many pending topics. So, it’s better to start from day one. </p>

            </li>
            <li>
            	<span class="TipsSubHeading"><strong>Planning</strong></span>:
                <p>Create a flexible time table. There is always a contingency which leads to the failure of a plan. A test, meeting with a relative, a party (wouldn’t attend one if I were in your shoes for at least the span of two years), a special occasion etc. Creating a flexible time table is very important. It will help you counter contingencies properly and save you time which you could rather use more productively.</p>
                <p>Set a fixed number of days after which you will do a detailed analysis on the progress you have made and the amount of work you have to do further. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
            	<span class="TipsSubHeading"><strong>Patience</strong></span>:
                <p>People fail to understand that education is a human system, not a mechanical one. There are many topics that may take you months to even start building an intuition for. I experienced the same with Mechanics. It took me roughly 3 months to get the hang of it. Even after 2 years of practising, there are still questions that I might struggle with. So if there are topics which take you time. Take them as a test of your patience.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            	<span class="TipsSubHeading"><strong>Breaks</strong></span>:
                <p>The difference between two students of the same calibre (where one being a successful one and other one but one being a good and one being a bad is because of the difference in dedication. You must and should be dedicated to the work you do. </p>
                <p>Take breaks frequently. According to scientific study,  Watching TV doesn’t always imply breaks. It seems simple but Television screens take you too far from everything. It makes things difficult to come back to. A better idea would be to do say, grocery shopping or maybe walking near your house. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
            	<span class="TipsSubHeading"><strong>Expectations</strong></span>:
            <p>You expect yourself to achieve ‘at least’ this much in a test. If you succeed you become happy and more confident. This confidence can slowly turn to over confidence. And if you fail to achieve what you expected, your confidence slowly fades away. By expecting yourself to do something you trap yourself in an endless maze.</p>
            <p>Writing JEE Main 2016, I had set a score in my mind. Every time I couldn’t answer a question, I saw the seat going away from me. Because of this, I couldn’t answer the other questions properly as my mind was still clogged with the thoughts of losing my desired seat. And because of these negative and useless thoughts, I kept on forgetting to save many of my answers after marking them (in the Online Paper). <em>To students who will be writing any sort of online examination. I suggest them to read the instructions very carefully.</em> </p>
            </li>
            <li>
            	<span class="TipsSubHeading"><strong>Testing</strong></span>:
                <p>You should always be ready for writing tests no matter how prepared you are. Tests give you an insight on your preparation. They highlight a few mistakes in your concepts which otherwise won’t be noticed very easily. After a test, it is very important to analyse your paper. Understand your mistakes very carefully and correct them. And never neglect the silly mistakes!
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            	<span class="TipsSubHeading"><strong>Recommended Books</strong></span>:
                <br>
                        <div class="TipsSub2Heading">Organic &amp; Inorganic Chemisrty: </div>
                        <p>Generally, people recommend books like Concise Inorganic Chemistry by JD Lee, Solomons for Organic Chemistry, Organic and Inorganic chemistry from Cengage. Instead, the first step should be to study from the NCERT textbooks. You can then proceed with the other guides that you have. Modern Inorganic Chemistry by C. Chambers and A.K. Holliday for Inorganic do not cover the entire syllabus, but they cover minute details that you won’t find in any other books.  </p>
                        <p>For Organic, 3000 Solved Questions from Tata McGraw Hill publication or New Pattern Chemistry for JEE Advanced will give you a rough but a clean idea on how to approach questions. Most of the solutions are quite detailed but there a few printing errors in the question. </p>
                        <p>For Inorganic, a large number of MCQs from various past papers, standardised books such as Dinesh (Despite it being more medical examination oriented) can be used for preparation. </p>
                		<div class="TipsSub2Heading">Physical Chemisrty:</div>
                        <p>Cengage New Pattern Chemistry for JEE Advanced and Physical Chemistry by Peter Atkins are a few good books. The concept building can be covered through Peter Atkin’s book and the MCQs can be done from the Cengage New Pattern Chemistry. </p>
                        <div class="TipsSub2Heading">Physics:</div>
                        <p>Books can be classified in two categories: </p>
                        Classics: That have stood the test of time 
                                <ul>
                                	<li>Fundamentals of Physics by Resnick and Halliday</li>
                                    <li>Concepts of Physics by HC Verma</li>
                                    <li>Problems in General Physics by IE Irodov</li>
                                	<p>Both Fundamentals of Physics and Concepts of Physics have quite similar contents but their presentation is different. The presentation matters a lot because it connects the readers to the contents through language, examples etc. In my opinion, a student should read a chapter from both the books and understand the different approaches to a similar concept. </p>
                                </ul>
                        Non-Classics: That still need to prove their mettle
                                <ul>
                                	<li>Cengage (BM Sharma)</li>
                                    <li>Arihant (DC Pandey)</li>

                                    <li>IIT JEE Physics (1978-2015: 38 years) Topic-wise Complete Solutions </li>
                                    <p>These books are written for the sole purpose of cracking the IIT JEE and you will miss "Enjoy the Physics" component in most of them.</p>
                                </ul>
                        <div class="TipsSub2Heading">Mathematics:</div>
                        <p>ML Khanna’s IIT Mathematics is one of the best books you can find for Mathematics. Though students may also refer guides such as Mathematics by G Tewani Cengage Publication or Objective Approach to Mathematics by Amit M Agarwal. For the latter two, it is recommended that you pick one book up and see the book which matches your frequency. </p>
